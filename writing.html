        <p>Holden Caulfield forms his expectations based on childhood experiences, such as the death of his brother Allie, causing him to idealize innocence. In juxtaposition, Bud tries preserving the bland routine of Pleasantville, but eventually accepts the changes occurring in the town ultimately proving that accepting change is necessary for healthy personal growth.</p>

        <p>Holden Caulfield forms his expectations based on childhood experiences, such as the death of his brother Allie, causing him to idealize innocence.

<div class="container-fluid description">
    <div class="col-md-5 col-md-offset-1">
        <h3>Original Body Paragraph</h3>
        <p>Holden’s pursuit to preserve innocence isolates himself from his peers. Explaining his motivation in life, Holden announces: “‘What I have to do, I have to catch  everybody if they start going over the cliff-I mean, they’re running and they don’t look where they’re going...I’d just be the catcher in the rye and all’” (Salinger 173). If the cliff represents the loss of innocence, Holden stops kids from losing innocence, forcing them to conform to his idealistic fantasies. Allie represents the quintessence of innocence, meaning that by preserving innocence in children, Holden also preserves the memory of Allie. His obsession with innocence isolates Holden from his peers, especially as he grows into his adolescence. By speaking consistently in the passive voice, Holden isolates himself and attempts to disconnect himself from everyone around him. This contradicts Holden’s need for children to conform to his memory of Allie, causing his failure to understand the world around him. In truth, Holden’s behavior mirrors that of a child at times, which further distances him from his peers. The unhealthy grow that came from Holden’s incompetence to move on from his brother results in his isolation.</p>
