        <h3>Original Body Paragraph</h3>
        <p>Holden’s pursuit to preserve innocence isolates himself from his peers. Explaining his motivation in life, Holden announces: “‘What I have to do, I have to catch  everybody if they start going over the cliff-I mean, they’re running and they don’t look where they’re going...I’d just be the catcher in the rye and all’” (Salinger 173). If the cliff represents the loss of innocence, Holden stops kids from losing innocence, forcing them to conform to his idealistic fantasies. Allie represents the quintessence of innocence, meaning that by preserving innocence in children, Holden also preserves the memory of Allie. His obsession with innocence isolates Holden from his peers, especially as he grows into his adolescence. By speaking consistently in the passive voice, Holden isolates himself and attempts to disconnect himself from everyone around him. This contradicts Holden’s need for children to conform to his memory of Allie, causing his failure to understand the world around him. In truth, Holden’s behavior mirrors that of a child at times, which further distances him from his peers. The unhealthy grow that came from Holden’s incompetence to move on from his brother results in his isolation.</p>

            I have always found solving problems enjoyable; from solving puzzles with family to computer programming. This past year I challenged myself and took the class AP Computer Science. I thrived in the class with little struggle. The concepts came easily to me and I would finish the assignments a week before they were due. However, recursion was the one topic I had difficulty with.  A standard mathematical definition of recursion is the process of defining a function or calculating a number by the repeated application of an algorithm. In computer science, recursion takes place with procedures or methods (think of these as a verb in a program, these elements do some action). When a method calls itself, it becomes recursive.
        </p>
        <h3>Example of a Recursive Method</h3>
        <pre>
	public static int <mark>sum(int n)</mark>
	// returns the sum of all integers 1 + 2 + .... + n-1 + n
	{

		if ( n == 0 ) {
			return n;
		}
		else {
			return <mark>sum( n - 1 )</mark> + n;
		}

	}
            <samp>If n = 3 the output is 6 | 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 </samp>
        </pre>
        <p class="description">
            During this chapter, we had to create recursive methods and predict the output of recursive methods. I read the chapter and still did not fully grasp the topic. I was not alone, much of the class struggled with recursion also. Our teacher helped by working through problems on the front board, but still I did not fully grasp the chapter. The fact our class struggled with recursion is pretty ironic since recursion happens everyday in our lives. Trees, for example, have a recursive structure. A tree starts with a truck, then splits into two trunks, and so on. For our chapter assignment, we had to create recursive methods that modeled summation, the Fibonacci numbers, exponentiation, and others. I would work for an hour or two every night trying to understand the assignment and the recursion involved. I would test code until I got one part of the assignment correct, and then I would move on continuing the process. If you think about it, I was creating recursive methods while taking a recursive approach to the problem (trying some code and repeating the process if I did not achieve the desired output). It was painstaking, but after hours of working I finally came to a better understanding of the topic. I came away after doing the programming assignment with a profound new knowledge of the subject. I had solved the puzzle through hard work and focus, giving me great satisfaction. This proved to me through hard work and the motivation to succeed, you can accomplish taks you would not have guessed you could.
