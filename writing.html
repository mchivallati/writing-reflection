            <h2>Beginning of the Year Example:</h2><br>
            <i>"'It excited him, too, that many men had already loved Daisy--it increased her value in his eye' (Fitzgerald 149). The words “It excited him”represent Gatsby’s first reaction to Daisy. She excites him because she could grant him access to the status and wealth he wants. Just as he wants fame and fortune, Gatsby only wants Daisy.  By using the pronoun “It”, Fitzgerald suggests that Daisy serves as an object to Gatsby. A means to achieving his goal of striking it rich. She had many people court her before and it made her a more elusive prize. Gatsby walks through the world of the rich; a place where he does not belong. Men expect women to serve as ever-loyal objects for their own needs during the nineteen twenties."</i>
            <br>
            <br>
            Not only do I not introduce the quote well, I count 3 separate ideas with this one paragraph. In addition, I do not follow my ideas through completely. I present one idea and move on to the next one without even explaining the connection to the reader.

            <h2>End of the Year Example:</h2><br>
            <i>"Allie’s death occurs when Holden 'was only thirteen, and they were going to have me psychoanalyzed and all, because I broke all the windows in the garage' (Salinger 38-39). Breaking all the windows in a garage clearly indicates that his brothers death affects Holden in a drastic way. Holden’s violent outburst pushes 'his parents [to] consider psychoanalysis way back then, at age 13' (Dexter Martin 508). Coping with his brothers death, Holden begins idealizing all the great qualities of Allie, namely Allie’s innocence. Holden never truly reconciles with Allie’s death. The inability to move on from traumatizing situations explains Holden’s inability to accept change. Holden’s failure to move on from his brother starts his unhealthy growth as he develops into an adult."</i>
            <br>
            <br>
            In this example I introduce my quotes and explore on 2 solid ideas. I use the second idea to transition to the next paragraph, creating a consistent flow through my paper; also connecting it to my thesis and overarching claim..
